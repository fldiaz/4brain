       "(\"Avian influenza is an acute viral respiratory disease that causes severe damage to the poultry industry because it results in high mortality. Recent global outbreaks of avian influenza caused by the avian influenza virus (AIV) poses a serious public health threat because of potential transmission among humans. Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are further divided into subtypes according to the combination of 2 major immunogenic surface glycoprotein components: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are present on the surface of viral envelopes [1, 2] . At the initial stage of viral infection, HA binds to the host respiratory cell receptor, which contains sialic acid, allowing the virus to enter the host cell through the endosomal pathway [3, 4] . HA is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with a globular head and a stem region that are both exposed to the outside of the membrane [5] . These regions contain N-linked oligosaccharides [6] , which have been known to affect the functional properties of HA [7, 8] . Glycosylation sites in the peptide sequences are highly conserved, indicating functional significance for HA glycosylation [9] . HA is synthesized as a precursor protein (HA0) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage into HA1 and HA2 subunits; HA1 mediates initial contact with the cell membrane, and HA2 is responsible for membrane fusion [10, 11] . HA is the primary target for antiviral agents such as infectivity-neutralizing antibodies [4] and nucleic acid aptamers [12] . The recombinant HA1 subunit, expressed and purified from bacteria, induces an immune response against the influenza virus in humans [13] and is sufficient for screening antiviral RNA aptamers [14] . The recombinant HA protein, which retains glycosylation, has been expressed and produced in a baculovirus/insect cell system, which exhibited enhanced HA inhibition and virus neutralization [15] . Aptamers are nucleic acid ligands that bind to a specific target molecule with high affinity. They are usually obtained from an oligonucleotide library harboring random sequences by using the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) method [16, 17] . Compared with protein antibodies, aptamers have many advantages over protein antibodies, such as high affinity, rapid synthesis, low cost, low-temperature sensitivity, large-scale production, and ease of chemical modification [12] . To date, aptamers have been used in a wide range of applications as research reagents, for medical diagnosis, and as biosensor or therapeutic tools against viruses and cancer. [18, 19] . Previously, our group selected an RNA aptamer against HA1 of subtype H5 AIV, which specifically binds to HA1 and inhibits hemagglutination of erythrocytes in vitro [14] . The HA1-specific RNA aptamer HAS15-5 was screened using the recombinant HA1-GST fusion protein that lacks glycosylation because of its expression in bacteria [14] . However, RNA aptamers specific to glycosylated HA rather than unglycosylated HA would be preferable for blocking and inhibiting influenza virus entry into host cells. In the present study, glycosylated hemagglutinin (gHA1) subtype H5 AIV was expressed from a recombinant baculovirus. gHA1 was expressed in a suspension culture of insect cells by infection with the recombinant baculovirus for glycosylation modifications. We isolated RNA aptamers that specifically bind to the gHA1 protein and demonstrated that the selected RNA aptamer, HA12-16, efficiently inhibited viral infection in host cells and enhanced cell viability. For suspension culture of insect cells, Sf21 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and TriEx Sf9 (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) cells were grown in 100 ml of Sf-900 serum-free media (Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, CA) and SFX-Insect cell culture media (Hyclone, Logan, UT), respectively, in 500-ml baffled glass flasks and were incubated at 27uC in a rotary shaker at 90 rpm. For maintaining the insect cells in monolayer cultures, cells were subcultured every 3 days by diluting seed cultures from 5.0610 5 cells/ml to a cell density of 2.5610 4 cells/ml with fresh media. The cells were then grown in monolayer cultures at 27uC. The full-length gene encoding the receptor-binding domain of hemagglutinin (HA1) from influenza virus strain A/wild-duck/ Korea/ES/2004 (H5N2) was obtained, as previously described [14] . The HA1 gene was amplified by PCR and digested with XhoI and HindIII and then subcloned into the pBAC6 baculovirus transfer vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), which contained 6 His-tag at the N-terminal and signal peptides for protein secretion in insect cells. Recombinant pBAC6 plasmids and linearized baculovirus DNA were co-transfected into Sf21 insect cells, as described in the BD BaculoGold baculovirus expression system protocols (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Briefly, recombinant pBAC6/HA plasmids (2 mg) and linearized baculovirus DNA (0.5 mg) were mixed in Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 5 min and then added to 1 ml of Sf-900 serum-free media. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the DNA mixture was added to the Sf21 cells (2.0610 6 cells/ ml) in the T25 flask and incubated at 28uC for 4 h while rocking back and forth. Following the rocking incubation, the DNA mixture was removed, and 4 ml of fresh Sf-900 serum-free media was added to insect cells. The insect cells were then incubated at 28uC for 4 days, and the supernatant, which was enriched with recombinant baculovirus (pBAC6/HA), was collected by centrifugation at 1000 6 g for 5 min. The gHA1 protein was expressed in a suspension culture of TriEx-Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant pBAC6/HA baculovirus. TriEx-Sf9 cells that were grown in suspension culture (2.5610 5 cells/ml) were infected with the recombinant pBAC6/ HA baculovirus with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.0 and incubated at 28uC for 3 days. Post-infection with the baculovirus, the culture supernatant containing the secreted protein was harvested by centrifugation at 1000 6 g for 5 min. All viral supernatants were ultra-filtered with the equilibrium buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) through polyethersulfone (PES) membranes of MWCO 5 kDa at a flow rate 120 ml/ min using the tangential flow filtration system (PALL, Port Washington, NY) for concentration and diafiltration. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-NTA His Trap affinity column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), which was pre-equilibrated with the equilibrium buffer. The column was washed twice, and the recombinant gHA1 was eluted with a gradient from 0.1 to 1 M imidazole in the equilibration buffer. The eluted fractions were collected and concentrated with a Centricon Plus-20 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE for the presence of His-tagged gHA1 protein. The gHA1-containing fractions identified by the band corresponding to 50 kDa were then loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), and eluted at a flow rate 1.5 ml/min. Pure protein fractions were dialyzed against buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 150 mM NaCl). Purified gHA1 was quantified using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the reference standard. The identity of the purified protein was determined by immunoblotting with mouse AIV H5N1 HA polyclonal antibodies (ProSci, Poway, CA) and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The glycosylation status of the recombinant gHA1 protein was determined with Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) that cleaves the complex oligosaccharides at N-linked glycosylations. Briefly, purified gHA1 (3 mg) was denatured in buffer (0.5% SDS and 4 mM DTT), heated at 100uC for 10 min, and subsequently incubated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the presence of HA1 was subsequently determined by immunoblotting, as described above. To conduct the SELEX procedure, an RNA pool of random sequences (RNA library) was produced by PCR and by in vitro transcription of the DNA template containing 40 random nucleotides, as previously described [20] . The His-tagged HA1 glycoprotein (50 mg) was immobilized on Ni-NTA spin trap columns (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The random RNA library (6 mg) was denatured at 85uC for 5 min and then incubated at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole). At every iteration of SELEX, negative selection was performed to remove RNAs bound to Ni-NTA resins in columns by passing the RNA pool through separate Ni-NTA spin trap columns. After three iterative rounds of negative selection, the unbound RNAs were collected and reloaded onto new Ni-NTA spin trap columns that were charged with His-tagged gHA1. Next, the column was washed 3 times with binding buffer, and the bound RNA was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 300 mM imidazole). The RNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation. The purified RNA was subjected to RT-PCR and in vitro transcription to generate the RNA library for the next round of SELEX. The amount of His-tagged HA1 glycoprotein used for SELEX was gradually reduced from 50 to 5 mg to enhance stringency of the selection procedure. After the 12th round of SELEX, the amplified cDNA was cloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and then transformed into E. coli by heat shock at 42uC. The plasmid DNA from each clone was prepared and sequenced, and each RNA aptamer was generated by in vitro transcription using the linearized recombinant plasmid that harbored the RNA aptamer sequence. Secondary structures of selected RNA aptamer sequences were predicted by the M-Fold web server, which is based on Zuker's algorithm [21] . To compare the binding affinity of the RNA library at each round, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out as previously described [14] . Briefly, 1.5 mg of gHA1 protein was loaded and immobilized onto the Ni-NTA spin trap column, and 4 mg of RNA pool from each round of SELEX was loaded onto the column. The column containing the RNA-protein complex was then washed 3 times with 200 ml of the binding buffer used in SELEX, and unbound RNAs were collected as flow-through. The RNAs that bound to the gHA1 protein were then eluted from the column by 3 consecutive washes with 200 ml of the elution buffer used in SELEX. Protein-bound RNAs were then extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, and the extracted RNAs from each elution were subjected to RT-PCR using aptamer-specific primers. The conditions for PCR were as follows: 11 cycles of 94uC for 30 s, 55uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 30 s. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel to measure the amount of DNA that was amplified from each eluant, and the amplified DNA bands on the gel were quantified using the Gel-Pro analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Alternatively, to compare each RNA aptamer candidate that originated from the final round of SELEX, a nitrocellulose filter binding assay [22] was performed to measure the binding affinities of RNA aptamers with the gHA1 protein. Each RNA aptamer generated by in vitro transcription was dephosphorylated and the 59-end-labeled with [c-32 P] ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The 59-32 P end-labeled RNA aptamer (5 nM) was incubated with the gHA1 protein (500 nM) in binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1.3 mM MgCl 2 ) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was filtered under vacuum onto double filters composed of a positively charged Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) beneath the nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) using a 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then washed twice with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl) and dried at room temperature. Filters were then assayed for radioactivity remaining in proteinbound RNAs and free RNAs retained on the nitrocellulose membrane and the hybond N+ membrane, respectively. Radioactivity was measured and quantified on a Cyclone Phosphor-Imager (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), and the fraction of protein-bound RNAs was determined using the amount of RNA remaining on the nitrocellulose membrane relative to the total amount of RNA present in both membranes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Preparation of 39-biotinylated RNAs occurred by ligation of biotinylated cytidine to the 39-end of RNA using the 39-end biotinylation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Briefly, the non-labeled RNAs (50 pmol) were heated at 85uC for 5 min, immediately put on ice, and added to the reaction mixture (40 U RNase inhibitor, 1 nM biotinylated cytidine (bis) phosphate, T4 RNA ligase, and 30% polyethylene glycol) in RNA ligase reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP). After the reaction mixture was incubated at 16uC overnight to increase ligation efficiency, 39-biotinylated RNAs were then extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the wells of a nickel-coated plate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were incubated overnight with the purified gHA1 (0.5 mg) at 4uC. The wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBS-T; 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) 3 times and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h to avoid non-specific binding. After washing, 30 ng of 39-biotinylated RNAs was added to wells (100 ml in PBS per well) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were then washed with PBS-T three times, and the protein-bound biotinylated RNAs were detected by incubation with 100 ml of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:8000 in PBS-T, Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the color development was initiated by adding 100 ml of 3,39,5,59-tetrametylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to each well, and stopped by adding 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a VICTOR X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (KCLB, Seoul, Korea) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Influenza virus strain A/Victoria/210/ 2009 (Reassortant NYMC X-187) H3N2 grown in the allantoic cavity of 11-day-old embryonated hen eggs was used for infection into MDCK cells. The titer of virus used for infection was evaluated by the infection of MDCK cells with expression, because the tissue culture infective doses lead to 50% infected cells (TCID 50 ) [23] . MDCK cells were seeded on 96-well plates (5610 3 /well) 24 h before the experiment. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were maintained as-is or infected with the influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 in the presence or absence of the selected RNA aptamer (50 nM). The cells were further incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37uC for 24 h. The cell media were removed after incubation, and cell viability was assayed by adding 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) dissolved in PBS to each well and incubation at 37uC for 4 h. The supernatants were aspirated, and the formazan dyes were dissolved in 100 ml/well dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma). The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a VICTOR X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). MDCK cells were placed in 5610 4 /wells on 8-well chamber glass slides (Nunc, Penfield, NY) prior to the experiment. The cells were washed twice in PBS and then added to a mixture containing the virus and the designated aptamer sample. The MDCK cells were maintained as-is or infected with the influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 with or without 30 min of pre-incubation with the HA12-16 RNA aptamer (100 nM). MDCK cells were also treated with the RNA aptamer without viral infection as a control. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. The influenza virus antigen HA was detected by incubating the cultures with a mouse anti-H3 (H3N2) antibody (diluted to 1:100 in PBS, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 3 washes in PBS for at least 5 min per wash. Primary antibodies were detected with FITCconjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibodies (Abcam). Nuclei were visualized using DAPI (Sigma) staining. Immunofluorescence images of the cells were obtained using an AxioCam MRc5 digital camera equipped with an Axio Imager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The HA1 subunit of hemagglutinin in AIV has been previously expressed in and purified from E. coli [14] , which produces unglycosylated protein. Because HA is an N-glycosylated glycoprotein with a globular head and stem regions [24] , proper posttranslational glycosylation and protein folding might be required for its function [9] . Hence, we expressed recombinant HA1 in insect cells to obtain the glycosylated HA of AIV by using the baculovirus expression system [15] . The baculovirus expression system can produce post-translationally modified and biologically active recombinant proteins from insect cells. A pBAC6 baculovirus plasmid carrying the full-length HA1 gene was cloned and transfected into Sf21 insect cells. The morphology of the infected insect cells became larger and irregular (data not shown). Four days post-infection, the secreted recombinant HA1 was collected and purified. The His-tagged gHA1 recombinant protein was purified through the combined use of Ni-NTA His Trap affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A , the gHA1 protein fused to His-tag revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Although the molecular weight of gHA1 is estimated to be about 46 kDa, including 10 kDa of signal sequence plus the His-tag, a slightly higher molecular weight of 50 kDa appeared in SDS-PAGE, probably due to glycosylation. To confirm whether the purified recombinant HA1 was Nglycosylated during post-translational processing, the purified protein was treated with PNGase F that cleaves glycans from the protein. As shown in Fig. 1B , PNGase F-treated samples had bands that migrated further owing to a loss of glycans, within which the predicted size of unglycosylated HA1 was about 46 kDa. Thus, the purified recombinant HA protein was Nglycosylated and was used for the subsequent RNA aptamer selection procedure (SELEX). To obtain antiviral RNA aptamers specific to gHA1 of AIV using SELEX, an RNA library containing 40 random nucleotides (,10 24 nucleic acid sequences) was initially prepared by PCR and subsequent in vitro transcription of the DNA template ( Fig. 2A) . Twelve iterative rounds of the selection process were performed by increasing the stringencies of RNA binding to the gHA1 protein as the rounds progressed. Starting from the 5th round, more strict conditions were employed by reducing the protein concentration in each subsequent round: 25 mg (rounds 5-6), 12.5 mg (rounds 7-8), 6.25 mg (rounds 9-10), and 5 mg (rounds [11] [12] . After the 12th round of selection and amplification, the amplified cDNA of the final round was subcloned, and 26 individual aptamer clones were sequenced. Based on the degenerated sequences of these clones, sequences of 26 clones were classified into 4 groups (Fig. 2B) . The population frequency of the selected RNA aptamers was 42.3.26.9.19.2.11.5% in decreasing percentage ranks (Fig. 2B) . Each RNA aptamer group has a conserved sequence that might be considered a binding site Figure 4 . Binding of the RNA SELEX pools to gHA1. The gHA1 protein charged in Ni-NTA spin trap columns was eluted with buffer solution containing the initial RNA pool, the 5th, 9th, and 12th round RNA pools, or no RNA (negative control, NC). Elution with imidazole buffer was collected and subjected to RT-RCR. Amplified cDNAs indicating the gHA1-bound RNAs were stained with ethidium bromide on 1.5% agarose gel after electrophoresis and were quantified. Relative amounts of the gHA1-bound RNAs are shown in the graph. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g004 Figure 5 . Affinity measurements of selected RNA aptamers to gHA1. (A) Each 32 P end-labeled RNA aptamer was incubated with gHA1, and the reaction sample was then filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose membrane and applied to the double-filter dot-blot apparatus. The amounts of 32 P end-labeled RNA aptamers retained on the membrane in the presence of gHA1 were radioactively measured and quantified. Percentage binding to the gHA1 protein relative to the highest value is shown in the graph. (B) The immobilized gHA1 protein (0.5 mg) was incubated with each 39-biotinylated RNA sample (30 ng) as indicated. After addition of streptavidin-conjugated HRP, the amount of the gHA1-aptamer complex was measured by absorbance reading at 450 nm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g005 specific to the gHA1 protein. The 4 RNA aptamer sequences identified in the 12th selection pool were predicted for the secondary structures of RNA using the M-Fold program, which is based on Zuker's algorithm [21] . RNA aptamers appear to contain a number of stem and loop structures, in which conserved sequences mostly reside at the stemand-loop region in the RNA secondary structure (Fig. 3) . These conserved sequences in each RNA aptamer are believed to be exposed to facilitate interactions with the HA1 protein [14, 20, 25] . The conserved sequences could constitute a binding motif specific to gHA1, whereas the stem structures of other sequences could merely stabilize the secondary structure of RNA. After 12 rounds of iterative SELEX cycles, the gHA1 protein binding affinity of the 12th RNA pool was compared with that of the initial RNA pool and the 5th and the 9th RNA pools were compared through the semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplification of RNAs bound to the target protein (Fig. 4) . For this experiment, the same amount of RNAs from each round was loaded onto an affinity column charged with the gHA1 protein. The affinityeluted fractions (gHA1-bound RNAs) were collected and subjected to RT-PCR. PCR cycles were limited to 11 cycles to avoid saturation of cDNA amplification [14] . cDNAs were visualized and quantified by ethidium bromide staining on an agarose gel, which reflected the amount of RNA bound to gHA1. Based on quantitation of amplified cDNA, the 12th round RNA pool was more tightly bound to gHA1 than any other round of RNA pool or the negative control containing irrelevant RNA sequences (Fig. 4) . To evaluate the binding affinity of the selected aptamer candidates against gHA1, we performed the double-filter assay for nitrocellulose-filter binding to analyze protein-RNA interactions [22, 26] . The dephosphoylated RNA aptamers were endlabeled with [c-32 P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Each 32 P-end labeled RNA aptamer (5 nM) was incubated with gHA1 (500 nM) for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was filtered through double filters containing nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 mm). After exposure of the nitrocellulose membrane for visualization of radioactive RNA aptamers bound to the protein, radioactivity was quantified and normalized as shown in Fig. 5A . RNA aptamer HAS15-5, which was previously selected against the unglycosylated HA1 protein [14] , did not significantly bind to the glycosylated HA1 protein. In contrast, among the selected RNA aptamer candidates against gHA1, the HA12-16 aptamer displayed the highest affinity. As an alternative attempt to measure binding affinity of the HA12-16 aptamer to the target protein, gHA1, we carried out a sandwich ELISA assay by adding 39-biotinylated aptamer RNAs to immobilized target proteins. As shown in Fig. 5B , HA12-16 aptamer RNA exhibited a higher absorbance value compared with other RNAs, such as the initial RNA library and the HAS15-5 aptamer. These results indicate that the selected RNA aptamer (HA12-16) against gHA1 is different from the HAS15-5 RNA aptamer that has been previously selected against the unglycosylated HA1. The virus surface glycoprotein HA plays a key role in mediating membrane fusion between the virus and host cellular membranes [4, 12] . We hypothesized that the RNA aptamer specific to gHA1 suppresses viral infection in the host cell by binding, thereby promoting viability in host cells exposed to the influenza virus. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the antiviral effect of the RNA aptamer candidates targeting the gHA1 viral surface protein by performing a host cell viability assay. MDCK cells were infected with the influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 and treated with the selected RNA aptamer candidates. After 24 h of incubation to The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then immunostained to test for the presence of the influenza virus by using mouse anti-HA antibodies and goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies conjugated to FITC as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were visualized by staining with DAPI; HA and nuclei are shown in green and blue fluorescence, respectively. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g006 facilitate viral infection into host cells, cell viability was measured using the MTT reagent. As shown in Fig. 6A , over 50% of the host cells survived in the presence of the RNA aptamers specific to gHA1 except for 1 RNA aptamer candidate (HA12-5). Additionally, the initial RNA pool and RNA aptamer specific to unglycosylated HA1 (HAS15-5) did not inhibit viral infection in host cells compared with the other RNA aptamer candidates. Among the aptamer candidates, the HA12-16 aptamer exhibited the highest antiviral activity by revealing comparable cell viability in the uninfected cells. Of importance, the extent of cell viability is positively correlated with the binding affinity of the RNA aptamer to gHA1, as revealed by the binding assay (Fig. 5A) . These results indicate that the most effective aptamer, HA12-16, prevents influenza infection by strongly binding to the gHA1 viral surface protein, thereby decreasing mortality of host cells. To further validate the antiviral activity of the HA12-16 aptamer in blocking viral binding and entry into host cells, we performed fluorescence microscopy analysis of the cells undergoing viral infection. For the assay, MDCK cells were incubated with the influenza virus in the presence or absence of the HA12-16 aptamer at 37uC for 24 h. The presence of the influenza virus was fluorescently analyzed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies bound to anti-HA primary antibodies. MDCK cells infected with the viruses were noticeably fluorescent because of the viruses attached to the cell membrane, whereas addition of the HA12-16 aptamer significantly reduced the FITC-fluorescence owing to the suppression of viral attachment to the cell membrane through aptamer-gHA1 binding (Fig. 6B) . When the cells were only treated with the HA12-16 aptamer, FITC fluorescence on the cells appeared to be similar to the one treated with the viruses plus the aptamer. This result suggests that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppresses viral attachment to the host cells by neutralizing the receptor-binding site of influenza virus HA, which results in the inhibition of viral replication. In this study, we isolated an RNA aptamer specific to the glycosylated receptor-binding domain of an AIV HA protein (gHA1) using SELEX. The HA1 gene was cloned from subtype H5 of AIV and expressed in insect cells, and the glycosylated recombinant HA1 protein was purified for screening of RNA aptamers. Glycosylation of the purified HA1 protein was confirmed by cleaving glycans with PNGase F. After the 12 rounds of iterative SELEX, the RNA pool that binds to the gHA1 protein was cloned and sequenced, and RNA secondary structures were predicted. Among the 4 representative RNA aptamer candidates, HA12-16 was chosen because of its high binding affinity to gHA1 and suppression of viral infection in host cells. These results suggest that the RNA aptamer can recognize the viral HA, likely at or around the receptor binding region required for the penetration of influenza virus into host cells [27] . Interestingly, the previously selected RNA aptamer against the unglycosylated HA (HAS15-5) failed to inhibit viral infection in host cells. Thus, the HA12-16 aptamer isolated in this study is expected to interrupt influenza invasion through specific binding to the glycosylated ectodomain of HA, which is crucial for viral attachment to the host cell membrane. In future research, the selected RNA aptamers should be modified to improve stability by base modification of nucleotides, capping of RNA fragments, and end-labeling with appropriate chemicals resistant to RNase. If a stable RNA aptamer is combined with an appropriate RNA delivery method, which is necessary for therapeutic use [28] , it can be used as an antiviral reagent that is comparable to antibodies and could be used as a therapeutic agent.\",\n",

       "[\"Avian influenza is an acute viral respiratory disease that causes severe damage to the poultry industry because it results in high mortality. Recent global outbreaks of avian influenza caused by the avian influenza virus (AIV) poses a serious public health threat because of potential transmission among humans. Influenza viruses belong to the family Orthomyxoviridae and are further divided into subtypes according to the combination of 2 major immunogenic surface glycoprotein components: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are present on the surface of viral envelopes [1, 2] . At the initial stage of viral infection, HA binds to the host respiratory cell receptor, which contains sialic acid, allowing the virus to enter the host cell through the endosomal pathway [3, 4] . HA is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with a globular head and a stem region that are both exposed to the outside of the membrane [5] . These regions contain N-linked oligosaccharides [6] , which have been known to affect the functional properties of HA [7, 8] . Glycosylation sites in the peptide sequences are highly conserved, indicating functional significance for HA glycosylation [9] . HA is synthesized as a precursor protein (HA0) that undergoes proteolytic cleavage into HA1 and HA2 subunits; HA1 mediates initial contact with the cell membrane, and HA2 is responsible for membrane fusion [10, 11] . HA is the primary target for antiviral agents such as infectivity-neutralizing antibodies [4] and nucleic acid aptamers [12] . The recombinant HA1 subunit, expressed and purified from bacteria, induces an immune response against the influenza virus in humans [13] and is sufficient for screening antiviral RNA aptamers [14] . The recombinant HA protein, which retains glycosylation, has been expressed and produced in a baculovirus/insect cell system, which exhibited enhanced HA inhibition and virus neutralization [15] . Aptamers are nucleic acid ligands that bind to a specific target molecule with high affinity. They are usually obtained from an oligonucleotide library harboring random sequences by using the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) method [16, 17] . Compared with protein antibodies, aptamers have many advantages over protein antibodies, such as high affinity, rapid synthesis, low cost, low-temperature sensitivity, large-scale production, and ease of chemical modification [12] . To date, aptamers have been used in a wide range of applications as research reagents, for medical diagnosis, and as biosensor or therapeutic tools against viruses and cancer. [18, 19] . Previously, our group selected an RNA aptamer against HA1 of subtype H5 AIV, which specifically binds to HA1 and inhibits hemagglutination of erythrocytes in vitro [14] . The HA1-specific RNA aptamer HAS15-5 was screened using the recombinant HA1-GST fusion protein that lacks glycosylation because of its expression in bacteria [14] . However, RNA aptamers specific to glycosylated HA rather than unglycosylated HA would be preferable for blocking and inhibiting influenza virus entry into host cells. In the present study, glycosylated hemagglutinin (gHA1) subtype H5 AIV was expressed from a recombinant baculovirus. gHA1 was expressed in a suspension culture of insect cells by infection with the recombinant baculovirus for glycosylation modifications. We isolated RNA aptamers that specifically bind to the gHA1 protein and demonstrated that the selected RNA aptamer, HA12-16, efficiently inhibited viral infection in host cells and enhanced cell viability. For suspension culture of insect cells, Sf21 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and TriEx Sf9 (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) cells were grown in 100 ml of Sf-900 serum-free media (Gibco BRL, Carlsbad, CA) and SFX-Insect cell culture media (Hyclone, Logan, UT), respectively, in 500-ml baffled glass flasks and were incubated at 27uC in a rotary shaker at 90 rpm. For maintaining the insect cells in monolayer cultures, cells were subcultured every 3 days by diluting seed cultures from 5.0610 5 cells/ml to a cell density of 2.5610 4 cells/ml with fresh media. The cells were then grown in monolayer cultures at 27uC. The full-length gene encoding the receptor-binding domain of hemagglutinin (HA1) from influenza virus strain A/wild-duck/ Korea/ES/2004 (H5N2) was obtained, as previously described [14] . The HA1 gene was amplified by PCR and digested with XhoI and HindIII and then subcloned into the pBAC6 baculovirus transfer vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), which contained 6 His-tag at the N-terminal and signal peptides for protein secretion in insect cells. Recombinant pBAC6 plasmids and linearized baculovirus DNA were co-transfected into Sf21 insect cells, as described in the BD BaculoGold baculovirus expression system protocols (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Briefly, recombinant pBAC6/HA plasmids (2 mg) and linearized baculovirus DNA (0.5 mg) were mixed in Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 5 min and then added to 1 ml of Sf-900 serum-free media. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the DNA mixture was added to the Sf21 cells (2.0610 6 cells/ ml) in the T25 flask and incubated at 28uC for 4 h while rocking back and forth. Following the rocking incubation, the DNA mixture was removed, and 4 ml of fresh Sf-900 serum-free media was added to insect cells. The insect cells were then incubated at 28uC for 4 days, and the supernatant, which was enriched with recombinant baculovirus (pBAC6/HA), was collected by centrifugation at 1000 6 g for 5 min. The gHA1 protein was expressed in a suspension culture of TriEx-Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant pBAC6/HA baculovirus. TriEx-Sf9 cells that were grown in suspension culture (2.5610 5 cells/ml) were infected with the recombinant pBAC6/ HA baculovirus with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.0 and incubated at 28uC for 3 days. Post-infection with the baculovirus, the culture supernatant containing the secreted protein was harvested by centrifugation at 1000 6 g for 5 min. All viral supernatants were ultra-filtered with the equilibrium buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl) through polyethersulfone (PES) membranes of MWCO 5 kDa at a flow rate 120 ml/ min using the tangential flow filtration system (PALL, Port Washington, NY) for concentration and diafiltration. The concentrated sample was loaded onto a 5-ml Ni-NTA His Trap affinity column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), which was pre-equilibrated with the equilibrium buffer. The column was washed twice, and the recombinant gHA1 was eluted with a gradient from 0.1 to 1 M imidazole in the equilibration buffer. The eluted fractions were collected and concentrated with a Centricon Plus-20 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE for the presence of His-tagged gHA1 protein. The gHA1-containing fractions identified by the band corresponding to 50 kDa were then loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), and eluted at a flow rate 1.5 ml/min. Pure protein fractions were dialyzed against buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 150 mM NaCl). Purified gHA1 was quantified using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the reference standard. The identity of the purified protein was determined by immunoblotting with mouse AIV H5N1 HA polyclonal antibodies (ProSci, Poway, CA) and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The glycosylation status of the recombinant gHA1 protein was determined with Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) that cleaves the complex oligosaccharides at N-linked glycosylations. Briefly, purified gHA1 (3 mg) was denatured in buffer (0.5% SDS and 4 mM DTT), heated at 100uC for 10 min, and subsequently incubated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction products were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the presence of HA1 was subsequently determined by immunoblotting, as described above. To conduct the SELEX procedure, an RNA pool of random sequences (RNA library) was produced by PCR and by in vitro transcription of the DNA template containing 40 random nucleotides, as previously described [20] . The His-tagged HA1 glycoprotein (50 mg) was immobilized on Ni-NTA spin trap columns (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The random RNA library (6 mg) was denatured at 85uC for 5 min and then incubated at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole). At every iteration of SELEX, negative selection was performed to remove RNAs bound to Ni-NTA resins in columns by passing the RNA pool through separate Ni-NTA spin trap columns. After three iterative rounds of negative selection, the unbound RNAs were collected and reloaded onto new Ni-NTA spin trap columns that were charged with His-tagged gHA1. Next, the column was washed 3 times with binding buffer, and the bound RNA was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, and 300 mM imidazole). The RNAs were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and subsequent ethanol precipitation. The purified RNA was subjected to RT-PCR and in vitro transcription to generate the RNA library for the next round of SELEX. The amount of His-tagged HA1 glycoprotein used for SELEX was gradually reduced from 50 to 5 mg to enhance stringency of the selection procedure. After the 12th round of SELEX, the amplified cDNA was cloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and then transformed into E. coli by heat shock at 42uC. The plasmid DNA from each clone was prepared and sequenced, and each RNA aptamer was generated by in vitro transcription using the linearized recombinant plasmid that harbored the RNA aptamer sequence. Secondary structures of selected RNA aptamer sequences were predicted by the M-Fold web server, which is based on Zuker's algorithm [21] . To compare the binding affinity of the RNA library at each round, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out as previously described [14] . Briefly, 1.5 mg of gHA1 protein was loaded and immobilized onto the Ni-NTA spin trap column, and 4 mg of RNA pool from each round of SELEX was loaded onto the column. The column containing the RNA-protein complex was then washed 3 times with 200 ml of the binding buffer used in SELEX, and unbound RNAs were collected as flow-through. The RNAs that bound to the gHA1 protein were then eluted from the column by 3 consecutive washes with 200 ml of the elution buffer used in SELEX. Protein-bound RNAs were then extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation, and the extracted RNAs from each elution were subjected to RT-PCR using aptamer-specific primers. The conditions for PCR were as follows: 11 cycles of 94uC for 30 s, 55uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 30 s. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel to measure the amount of DNA that was amplified from each eluant, and the amplified DNA bands on the gel were quantified using the Gel-Pro analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Alternatively, to compare each RNA aptamer candidate that originated from the final round of SELEX, a nitrocellulose filter binding assay [22] was performed to measure the binding affinities of RNA aptamers with the gHA1 protein. Each RNA aptamer generated by in vitro transcription was dephosphorylated and the 59-end-labeled with [c-32 P] ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The 59-32 P end-labeled RNA aptamer (5 nM) was incubated with the gHA1 protein (500 nM) in binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1.3 mM MgCl 2 ) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction mixture was filtered under vacuum onto double filters composed of a positively charged Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) beneath the nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare) using a 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then washed twice with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl) and dried at room temperature. Filters were then assayed for radioactivity remaining in proteinbound RNAs and free RNAs retained on the nitrocellulose membrane and the hybond N+ membrane, respectively. Radioactivity was measured and quantified on a Cyclone Phosphor-Imager (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT), and the fraction of protein-bound RNAs was determined using the amount of RNA remaining on the nitrocellulose membrane relative to the total amount of RNA present in both membranes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Preparation of 39-biotinylated RNAs occurred by ligation of biotinylated cytidine to the 39-end of RNA using the 39-end biotinylation kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Briefly, the non-labeled RNAs (50 pmol) were heated at 85uC for 5 min, immediately put on ice, and added to the reaction mixture (40 U RNase inhibitor, 1 nM biotinylated cytidine (bis) phosphate, T4 RNA ligase, and 30% polyethylene glycol) in RNA ligase reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP). After the reaction mixture was incubated at 16uC overnight to increase ligation efficiency, 39-biotinylated RNAs were then extracted by phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the wells of a nickel-coated plate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were incubated overnight with the purified gHA1 (0.5 mg) at 4uC. The wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBS-T; 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4) 3 times and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at room temperature for 1 h to avoid non-specific binding. After washing, 30 ng of 39-biotinylated RNAs was added to wells (100 ml in PBS per well) and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The wells were then washed with PBS-T three times, and the protein-bound biotinylated RNAs were detected by incubation with 100 ml of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:8000 in PBS-T, Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the color development was initiated by adding 100 ml of 3,39,5,59-tetrametylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL) to each well, and stopped by adding 2 M H 2 SO 4 . The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm using a VICTOR X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (KCLB, Seoul, Korea) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Influenza virus strain A/Victoria/210/ 2009 (Reassortant NYMC X-187) H3N2 grown in the allantoic cavity of 11-day-old embryonated hen eggs was used for infection into MDCK cells. The titer of virus used for infection was evaluated by the infection of MDCK cells with expression, because the tissue culture infective doses lead to 50% infected cells (TCID 50 ) [23] . MDCK cells were seeded on 96-well plates (5610 3 /well) 24 h before the experiment. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were maintained as-is or infected with the influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 in the presence or absence of the selected RNA aptamer (50 nM). The cells were further incubated in serum-free DMEM at 37uC for 24 h. The cell media were removed after incubation, and cell viability was assayed by adding 5 mg/ml MTT (Sigma) dissolved in PBS to each well and incubation at 37uC for 4 h. The supernatants were aspirated, and the formazan dyes were dissolved in 100 ml/well dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma). The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a VICTOR X3 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). MDCK cells were placed in 5610 4 /wells on 8-well chamber glass slides (Nunc, Penfield, NY) prior to the experiment. The cells were washed twice in PBS and then added to a mixture containing the virus and the designated aptamer sample. The MDCK cells were maintained as-is or infected with the influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 with or without 30 min of pre-incubation with the HA12-16 RNA aptamer (100 nM). MDCK cells were also treated with the RNA aptamer without viral infection as a control. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. The influenza virus antigen HA was detected by incubating the cultures with a mouse anti-H3 (H3N2) antibody (diluted to 1:100 in PBS, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). The antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by 3 washes in PBS for at least 5 min per wash. Primary antibodies were detected with FITCconjugated goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin secondary antibodies (Abcam). Nuclei were visualized using DAPI (Sigma) staining. Immunofluorescence images of the cells were obtained using an AxioCam MRc5 digital camera equipped with an Axio Imager A1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The HA1 subunit of hemagglutinin in AIV has been previously expressed in and purified from E. coli [14] , which produces unglycosylated protein. Because HA is an N-glycosylated glycoprotein with a globular head and stem regions [24] , proper posttranslational glycosylation and protein folding might be required for its function [9] . Hence, we expressed recombinant HA1 in insect cells to obtain the glycosylated HA of AIV by using the baculovirus expression system [15] . The baculovirus expression system can produce post-translationally modified and biologically active recombinant proteins from insect cells. A pBAC6 baculovirus plasmid carrying the full-length HA1 gene was cloned and transfected into Sf21 insect cells. The morphology of the infected insect cells became larger and irregular (data not shown). Four days post-infection, the secreted recombinant HA1 was collected and purified. The His-tagged gHA1 recombinant protein was purified through the combined use of Ni-NTA His Trap affinity chromatography and gel filtration. The purified protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A , the gHA1 protein fused to His-tag revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 50 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Although the molecular weight of gHA1 is estimated to be about 46 kDa, including 10 kDa of signal sequence plus the His-tag, a slightly higher molecular weight of 50 kDa appeared in SDS-PAGE, probably due to glycosylation. To confirm whether the purified recombinant HA1 was Nglycosylated during post-translational processing, the purified protein was treated with PNGase F that cleaves glycans from the protein. As shown in Fig. 1B , PNGase F-treated samples had bands that migrated further owing to a loss of glycans, within which the predicted size of unglycosylated HA1 was about 46 kDa. Thus, the purified recombinant HA protein was Nglycosylated and was used for the subsequent RNA aptamer selection procedure (SELEX). To obtain antiviral RNA aptamers specific to gHA1 of AIV using SELEX, an RNA library containing 40 random nucleotides (,10 24 nucleic acid sequences) was initially prepared by PCR and subsequent in vitro transcription of the DNA template ( Fig. 2A) . Twelve iterative rounds of the selection process were performed by increasing the stringencies of RNA binding to the gHA1 protein as the rounds progressed. Starting from the 5th round, more strict conditions were employed by reducing the protein concentration in each subsequent round: 25 mg (rounds 5-6), 12.5 mg (rounds 7-8), 6.25 mg (rounds 9-10), and 5 mg (rounds [11] [12] . After the 12th round of selection and amplification, the amplified cDNA of the final round was subcloned, and 26 individual aptamer clones were sequenced. Based on the degenerated sequences of these clones, sequences of 26 clones were classified into 4 groups (Fig. 2B) . The population frequency of the selected RNA aptamers was 42.3.26.9.19.2.11.5% in decreasing percentage ranks (Fig. 2B) . Each RNA aptamer group has a conserved sequence that might be considered a binding site Figure 4 . Binding of the RNA SELEX pools to gHA1. The gHA1 protein charged in Ni-NTA spin trap columns was eluted with buffer solution containing the initial RNA pool, the 5th, 9th, and 12th round RNA pools, or no RNA (negative control, NC). Elution with imidazole buffer was collected and subjected to RT-RCR. Amplified cDNAs indicating the gHA1-bound RNAs were stained with ethidium bromide on 1.5% agarose gel after electrophoresis and were quantified. Relative amounts of the gHA1-bound RNAs are shown in the graph. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g004 Figure 5 . Affinity measurements of selected RNA aptamers to gHA1. (A) Each 32 P end-labeled RNA aptamer was incubated with gHA1, and the reaction sample was then filtered through a pre-wetted nitrocellulose membrane and applied to the double-filter dot-blot apparatus. The amounts of 32 P end-labeled RNA aptamers retained on the membrane in the presence of gHA1 were radioactively measured and quantified. Percentage binding to the gHA1 protein relative to the highest value is shown in the graph. (B) The immobilized gHA1 protein (0.5 mg) was incubated with each 39-biotinylated RNA sample (30 ng) as indicated. After addition of streptavidin-conjugated HRP, the amount of the gHA1-aptamer complex was measured by absorbance reading at 450 nm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g005 specific to the gHA1 protein. The 4 RNA aptamer sequences identified in the 12th selection pool were predicted for the secondary structures of RNA using the M-Fold program, which is based on Zuker's algorithm [21] . RNA aptamers appear to contain a number of stem and loop structures, in which conserved sequences mostly reside at the stemand-loop region in the RNA secondary structure (Fig. 3) . These conserved sequences in each RNA aptamer are believed to be exposed to facilitate interactions with the HA1 protein [14, 20, 25] . The conserved sequences could constitute a binding motif specific to gHA1, whereas the stem structures of other sequences could merely stabilize the secondary structure of RNA. After 12 rounds of iterative SELEX cycles, the gHA1 protein binding affinity of the 12th RNA pool was compared with that of the initial RNA pool and the 5th and the 9th RNA pools were compared through the semi-quantitative RT-PCR amplification of RNAs bound to the target protein (Fig. 4) . For this experiment, the same amount of RNAs from each round was loaded onto an affinity column charged with the gHA1 protein. The affinityeluted fractions (gHA1-bound RNAs) were collected and subjected to RT-PCR. PCR cycles were limited to 11 cycles to avoid saturation of cDNA amplification [14] . cDNAs were visualized and quantified by ethidium bromide staining on an agarose gel, which reflected the amount of RNA bound to gHA1. Based on quantitation of amplified cDNA, the 12th round RNA pool was more tightly bound to gHA1 than any other round of RNA pool or the negative control containing irrelevant RNA sequences (Fig. 4) . To evaluate the binding affinity of the selected aptamer candidates against gHA1, we performed the double-filter assay for nitrocellulose-filter binding to analyze protein-RNA interactions [22, 26] . The dephosphoylated RNA aptamers were endlabeled with [c-32 P] ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Each 32 P-end labeled RNA aptamer (5 nM) was incubated with gHA1 (500 nM) for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was filtered through double filters containing nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 mm). After exposure of the nitrocellulose membrane for visualization of radioactive RNA aptamers bound to the protein, radioactivity was quantified and normalized as shown in Fig. 5A . RNA aptamer HAS15-5, which was previously selected against the unglycosylated HA1 protein [14] , did not significantly bind to the glycosylated HA1 protein. In contrast, among the selected RNA aptamer candidates against gHA1, the HA12-16 aptamer displayed the highest affinity. As an alternative attempt to measure binding affinity of the HA12-16 aptamer to the target protein, gHA1, we carried out a sandwich ELISA assay by adding 39-biotinylated aptamer RNAs to immobilized target proteins. As shown in Fig. 5B , HA12-16 aptamer RNA exhibited a higher absorbance value compared with other RNAs, such as the initial RNA library and the HAS15-5 aptamer. These results indicate that the selected RNA aptamer (HA12-16) against gHA1 is different from the HAS15-5 RNA aptamer that has been previously selected against the unglycosylated HA1. The virus surface glycoprotein HA plays a key role in mediating membrane fusion between the virus and host cellular membranes [4, 12] . We hypothesized that the RNA aptamer specific to gHA1 suppresses viral infection in the host cell by binding, thereby promoting viability in host cells exposed to the influenza virus. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the antiviral effect of the RNA aptamer candidates targeting the gHA1 viral surface protein by performing a host cell viability assay. MDCK cells were infected with the influenza virus H3N2 at an MOI of 0.1 and treated with the selected RNA aptamer candidates. After 24 h of incubation to The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were then immunostained to test for the presence of the influenza virus by using mouse anti-HA antibodies and goat anti-mouse polyclonal antibodies conjugated to FITC as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were visualized by staining with DAPI; HA and nuclei are shown in green and blue fluorescence, respectively. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0097574.g006 facilitate viral infection into host cells, cell viability was measured using the MTT reagent. As shown in Fig. 6A , over 50% of the host cells survived in the presence of the RNA aptamers specific to gHA1 except for 1 RNA aptamer candidate (HA12-5). Additionally, the initial RNA pool and RNA aptamer specific to unglycosylated HA1 (HAS15-5) did not inhibit viral infection in host cells compared with the other RNA aptamer candidates. Among the aptamer candidates, the HA12-16 aptamer exhibited the highest antiviral activity by revealing comparable cell viability in the uninfected cells. Of importance, the extent of cell viability is positively correlated with the binding affinity of the RNA aptamer to gHA1, as revealed by the binding assay (Fig. 5A) . These results indicate that the most effective aptamer, HA12-16, prevents influenza infection by strongly binding to the gHA1 viral surface protein, thereby decreasing mortality of host cells. To further validate the antiviral activity of the HA12-16 aptamer in blocking viral binding and entry into host cells, we performed fluorescence microscopy analysis of the cells undergoing viral infection. For the assay, MDCK cells were incubated with the influenza virus in the presence or absence of the HA12-16 aptamer at 37uC for 24 h. The presence of the influenza virus was fluorescently analyzed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies bound to anti-HA primary antibodies. MDCK cells infected with the viruses were noticeably fluorescent because of the viruses attached to the cell membrane, whereas addition of the HA12-16 aptamer significantly reduced the FITC-fluorescence owing to the suppression of viral attachment to the cell membrane through aptamer-gHA1 binding (Fig. 6B) . When the cells were only treated with the HA12-16 aptamer, FITC fluorescence on the cells appeared to be similar to the one treated with the viruses plus the aptamer. This result suggests that the HA12-16 RNA aptamer suppresses viral attachment to the host cells by neutralizing the receptor-binding site of influenza virus HA, which results in the inhibition of viral replication. In this study, we isolated an RNA aptamer specific to the glycosylated receptor-binding domain of an AIV HA protein (gHA1) using SELEX. The HA1 gene was cloned from subtype H5 of AIV and expressed in insect cells, and the glycosylated recombinant HA1 protein was purified for screening of RNA aptamers. Glycosylation of the purified HA1 protein was confirmed by cleaving glycans with PNGase F. After the 12 rounds of iterative SELEX, the RNA pool that binds to the gHA1 protein was cloned and sequenced, and RNA secondary structures were predicted. Among the 4 representative RNA aptamer candidates, HA12-16 was chosen because of its high binding affinity to gHA1 and suppression of viral infection in host cells. These results suggest that the RNA aptamer can recognize the viral HA, likely at or around the receptor binding region required for the penetration of influenza virus into host cells [27] . Interestingly, the previously selected RNA aptamer against the unglycosylated HA (HAS15-5) failed to inhibit viral infection in host cells. Thus, the HA12-16 aptamer isolated in this study is expected to interrupt influenza invasion through specific binding to the glycosylated ectodomain of HA, which is crucial for viral attachment to the host cell membrane. In future research, the selected RNA aptamers should be modified to improve stability by base modification of nucleotides, capping of RNA fragments, and end-labeling with appropriate chemicals resistant to RNase. If a stable RNA aptamer is combined with an appropriate RNA delivery method, which is necessary for therapeutic use [28] , it can be used as an antiviral reagent that is comparable to antibodies and could be used as a therapeutic agent.\",\n",
       " 'Managing what Cannot be Managed On the Possibility of Science Policy Barend van der Meulen Waldsterben. We are familiar with that term mainly from the 1980s, when acid rain led to the death of large tracts of Europe’s coniferous forests. But the phenomenon is in fact much older and occurred for the f irst time in Central and Eastern Europe in the nineteenth century. In the eighteenth century, Frederick the Great of Prussia had developed the concept of the modern state – a state involving itself in all facets of society. This also led to the idea of ‘f iscal forestry’, i.e. forestry intended to f ill the coffers of the state. Pursued systematically, this approach showed that some trees and some areas of forest produced higher yields than others. Birch and spruce, in particular, turned out to quickly yield a lot of timber, leading to the planting of large areas of production forest in Prussia. That was a success, and the approach spread to other parts of Europe. But what the ancient forests had never been able to teach the foresters became apparent in the nineteenth century. The emphasis on rapid production and the resulting monoculture led to the soil becoming exhausted and to Waldsterben, i.e. ‘forest dieback’ – the simultaneous death of large tracts of forest within only a short time. In his book Seeing like a State (1998), James Scott uses the example of f iscal forestry to show that when governments attempt to manage matters, they are doomed to simplif ication. (Scott, 1998) At f irst, such simplif ication appears to offer solely advantages, but in the long run things go wrong. Scott’s book – which is subtitled ‘How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed’ – otherwise mainly concerns large-scale modernist projects that we tend to see as being pursued by overambitious technocrats and governments blinded by ideology: Le Corbusier’s ville contemporaine, the Soviet collectivisation of agriculture, and the enforced creation of villages in African countries. That is a pity. The issue of how government can manage activities about which it actually knows too lit- tle is not only important for overambitious technocratic dictatorships. In the Dutch situation too, with a government that is by virtually all criteria normal, it is also relevant, certainly as regards science policy. After all, what does the government know about science? I know that after reading the above introduction there will be research- ers in the Netherlands who will instantly recognize my Prussian forestry 88 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN example as a metaphor for the country’s current system of science and scholarship. This system sees itself compelled by the ‘key economic sec- tors’ policy to focus on short-term economic yields (Valorisation! ‘From knowledge to skills to cash !’) and is slipping into a monoculture because of a lack of appreciation for the humanities and other supposedly economically useless knowledge. I myself don’t think things are really all that bad. Despite politicians and science administrators for thirty years now calling for more profiling, choices, ‘peaks in the delta’, focus areas and all the rest of it, the Netherlands, like other rich Western countries, has a broad portfolio of scientif ic and scholarly disciplines (Horlings and Van de Besselaar, 2012). The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science is the largest funder of research, and in its relationships with the Netherlands Organisation for Scientif ic Research (NWO), the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), and the universities it still adheres to the principle of ‘managing at a distance’. There is no question of any ‘science dieback’ in the Netherlands (KNAW, 2015). The recurring question for the government, however, is how knowledge for specif ic purposes can be encouraged within the broad palette of Dutch science and scholarship. The ‘key economic sectors’ are the most recent example of this. At the end of the last century, the aim was to encourage emerging f ields such as biotechnology, materials science, microelectronics, nanotechnology, and catalysis. In the 1970s, when the Netherlands briefly had a separate Minister for Science Policy, there was a research policy for such areas as toxicology, soil science, and demography. And ten years before that, scientists had raised the question of how to choose between different investments if an end were to come to the almost exponential increase in the budget for science in the 1950s (Weinberg, 1962,). It was at about that time that some Dutch professors began to push for an explicit science policy, and the former Advisory Council for Science Policy (RAWB) was set up. The initial recommendations by the new council concerned, inter alia, participation in CERN, investment in space research, and the possibility of involving persons other than scientists when making choices in the scientif ic f ield (National Archive, 2008,). So there would seem to be nothing new under the sun. But over the years there has been a growing understanding of the relationship between government and science – including the essential tension that there is – and there has been successful science policy. And what seemed successful or promising has come to a stop again. Based on game theory insights into the relationship between government and science and past experience, I shall attempt to analyse what possibilities exist for managing research. MANAGiNG WHAT cANNoT Be MANAGeD 89 Why have a science policy? Can government in fact manage scientif ic research? A legitimate counter- question is whether government should wish to do so. There are good rea- sons for leaving scientif ic research in the Netherlands to the free dynamics of science and the choices made by researchers, certainly if the value of knowledge is in itself a suff icient reason to fund research. But governments do not invest in science only in order to know – they also want to win. And knowledge is a powerful weapon. The US federal budget for research has its origins, inter alia, in the American Civil War, the Second World War, and the signif icantly named ‘War on Cancer’. The European research budget received a powerful boost in the 1990s when Japanese companies, with the support of their government, were winning the technological race in microelectronics. European companies such as Philips and Siemens sought and found support for additional investment at European level. And in our own country the ever-present threat of water is still always a good reason to have a world-renowned technological institute in this f ield, as well as research programmes, and several clusters of questions on the quality, management, and use of water in the Dutch National Research Agenda. In 1963, the then Minister of Education, Arts and Sciences, Theo Bot, defended the concept of science policy as follows: Science has come to occupy a central place in modern Western society, and there is virtually no sector of contemporary society in which it does not exert its influence to a greater or lesser extent. [...] At the same time, scientif ic research demands ever greater f inancial and human resources. Both these developments have led to science no longer being a matter for scientists in general, but a matter of general interest. [...] We cannot do without a deliberate policy. (Handelingen, 1963-64, pp. 729-731) The Minister went on to note that science policy must also recognize the value of ‘free research that is not aimed at increasing the standard of living’, must create the right conditions for such research, and must ensure that it does not focus too narrowly on the natural and technological sciences. Those are arguments that resonate into the present century. The Minister also added immediately that it [is] still too early to predict the solutions to which the reassessment of the Dutch organisation for science policy, which has now commenced, will ultimately lead. Every country, including the Netherlands, will need 90 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN to develop its own institutional and procedural solutions [...] It is not possible to indicate general rules for this [...]. And that brings us back to the core of the problem. Government wishes to pursue policy, and have good reasons for it, but how it should do so is often unclear. Knowledge for sale The question regarding ‘managing science’ can probably best be answered if we start from the simple idea that government must make choices and then ensure that we become the best in the fields it has chosen. And for those who do not wish to leave matters entirely to the government, ‘the Netherlands Ltd’ should make the choices and we should become the best in those f ields. There is a lot that can be said against such an approach. But the idea of making choices as the core of science policy is a constant theme of advisory reports, policy papers, and discussion contributions about science policy. That makes it at least a useful starting point for an essay on the issue of managing science. To put it in a rather less commercial manner: science is important for the welfare of society and the economy (as was forestry in Prussia). It is therefore an object of state concern, and the state must ensure that Dutch scientists carry out – or are able to carry out – the research that the country needs, and above all the research that the country really needs. This creates a relationship between government and scientists that goes beyond the former patronage relationships in which powerful administrators or rich patrons gave artists and scientists the scope to engage in the arts and science. A factor that should make it easier for government to make choices is that there is a f inancial relationship between government and researcher. This offers the possibility of a contract between the two parties. However, that contract concerns ‘knowledge’ and is therefore different to a contract by which government buys a new logo, commissions a new tunnel, or purchases off ice chairs. Although on the fringes of research policy, parts of applied research become the subject of calls for tenders which seem hardly to differ from the procurement procedures for a logo, tunnel, or off ice chair, it is generally the case that government knows too little to be able to specify what knowledge it needs. That immediately leads to the f irst experience- based conclusion: to buy knowledge, you need more than just money. Buying knowledge requires knowledge of knowledge. In 1972, the British government introduced the ‘customer-contractor’ principle for funding MANAGiNG WHAT cANNoT Be MANAGeD 91 policy-supporting research. The role of the government as a ‘customer’ for research needed to be more clearly separated from that of the researcher as a ‘contractor’ for research projects. In their book Governance and Research (1983), Maurice Kogan and Mary Henkel tracked several years of efforts by the Department of Health to implement this principle. The problem was always that in order to determine what its demand for knowledge was, the ministry needed advice from experts – in fact researchers who would ultimately also be the ones to carry out the assignments involved. The book is still instructive with a view to understanding why it is diff icult for ministries, including those in the Netherlands, to implement an effective knowledge policy and to manage research. Science policy as a game The ‘contractual relationship’ between government and researchers can be envisioned as a game. The outcome of a game is always dependent on the combination of the players’ strategies. In other words, it is not just what the government does that is relevant as regards whether it can manage science, but also how the researchers (or their organisations) respond to government policy. And vice versa. Whether the possibilities and needs to manage science also depend on the research strategies of the scientists. Do they allow the government to manage them? The general consensus among researchers is that they do not. In their view, government policy – at most – explains the problems, but not the capacity to thrive and be successful (Koier et al., 2016). The history of science policy shows, however, that not much new policy is established without the involvement of researchers and scientif ic organisations. Conditions can therefore be created in which scientists apparently still see the benefits of such policy. The science policy game displays features of a ‘principal-agent relation- ship’, i.e. a relationship between a client (the ‘principal’) and a contractor (the ‘agent’) in which the client does not have the knowledge needed in order to know whether it is getting value for money from the contractor. The client can try to control the contractor, but doing so is very expensive. It is much cheaper to trust the contractor. Because the client has insuff icient knowledge of the matter, the contractor may also pursue its own objectives rather than committing itself entirely to achieving those of the client. This is a relationship that frequently applies between a client and a professional. Someone who engages a lawyer trusts that the lawyer will devote his or her efforts to representing the client’s case, will actually spend 92 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN the hours he or she bills on dealing with the case, and will not waste time on a case if it is hopeless. But the lawyer may have his or her own objectives. She or he may in fact consider the case to be hopeless but – needing the fees to keep his or her f irm going – will continue to pursue the case even if doing so is contrary to the client’s actual interests. Both players in a principal-agent relationship have two options. The principal can trust or control the agent. The agent may comply with the principal’s expectations or pursue its own objectives. If the game is played endlessly, each of the four combinations of strategies is unstable. In each combination, one of the two players can increase its payoffs by switching strategy. If the government trusts, it is advantageous for the researcher to pursue his or her own curiosity. If the researcher pursues his or her own curiosity, it is more advantageous for the government to build in control mechanisms. If the government controls strictly, the researcher better comply with the requirements. If the researcher complies with the requirements, it is more advantageous for the government to trust... (Van der Meulen, 1998). In terms of game theory: a Nash equilibrium is lacking. Where social relationships are unstable but considered necessary, institu- tions arise that make possible a long-term relationship (North, 1990). One of these is the idea expressed by Vannevar Bush in his much-quoted report Science, The Endless Frontier (1945). Bush wrote the report during the Second World War, which in America led to a number of major mission-oriented research projects intended to contribute to victory in the short term. The most familiar example is the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb. The reason for Bush’s report was President Roosevelt’s question as to whether – once the military struggle had ceased – the R&D expenditure involved should be continued in peacetime, and if so, how. The core mes- sage of the report was that government must continue research efforts in peacetime too, but based on the trust that basic research can push back the boundaries of knowledge and will be useful in the long run. That trust could not be blind, however: to distribute funds a National Science Foundation had to be set up, headed by scientists who would ensure that the money found its way to the best researchers. That was not an obvious matter. It took a long time before Congress ap- proved the idea that not government itself would decide on the distribution of the money but rather those who received it. But for a government that actually dares to trust that scientific research will generate yields in the long term, this is a favourable configuration of players and strategies. Thanks to competition and mutual quality control between researchers, the govern- ment can be confident that the money will f ind its way to the right place MANAGiNG WHAT cANNoT Be MANAGeD 93 and will pay off in the long run. For researchers, this configuration provides the scope to pursue their own goals and is therefore interesting. As long as the cost of the ‘control’ – i.e. writing and evaluating proposals – remains within bounds and enough researchers are allocated funds, there is a Nash equilibrium. In the Netherlands, this combination of players and strategies has evolved into what we now know as the NWO’s Open Competition, and at European level into the European Research Council (ERC). However, the pressure on the contract has become extremely high. Even researchers who are clearly benefiting, or have benefited, wonder whether ‘the system’ has not gone too far and whether the perverse effects are not overwhelming the benefits (Science in Transition, 2013; Bollen and Scheffer, 2015). Development of the ‘f irst f low of funds’ in the Netherlands (i.e. direct government funding) shows a similar dynamic of institutionalization of confidence in evaluation practices. For a long time, f inancing of university research was based on blind trust. Funds were provided but there was no monitoring of whether they were utilized effectively. In 1979, the Minister pointed out in the Policy Memorandum on University Research [Beleidsnota Universitair Onderzoek] that it was unclear whether research funds were being spent efficiently: there was no division of tasks, the choice of themes for research was not sufficiently determined by social needs, and it was unclear whether performance was sufficient. What followed was a decade of division of tasks, concentration, selective contraction and growth, advisory commit- tees and conditional funding, and a great deal of frustration in the relationship between government and university researchers. But it did also lead to quality control at universities – in the form of external reviews of research, output indicators, and priorities – becoming something commonplace (Whitley and Gläser, 2007). The government’s trust is no longer blind but is well-founded. Some 35 years later, the Minister could inform the Dutch House of Representa- tives that ‘the Dutch scientific system performs extremely well in terms of quality and productivity’ (Minister of Education, Culture and Science, 2015). Aiming for socially relevant goals For situations in which government does have its own goals, this configura- tion of well-founded trust is not a satisfactory solution. Neither through competitions organised by research councils such as the NWO, NSF, and ERC nor through control mechanisms such as external reviews of research and output indicators can government manage matters in such a way that ‘the right kind’ of research takes place, in other words, research that ‘meets 94 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN the needs of society’, or, as it is termed in the recent Vision for Science 2025 document [Wetenschapsvisie 2025], ‘research with maximum impact’. One of the ways of achieving this is to organise competition oneself. In the UK, the government does this by means of the Research Excellence Framework. The remarkable thing about the Framework is that, although assessment is carried out by researchers, the criteria, and therefore what is considered to be high-quality research of the right kind, are formulated by the government. The REF describes in detail how research will be assessed, what criteria will apply, and how the universities can demonstrate that their research meets those criteria. To assess the impact of research, for example, a precise def inition is provided, a f ive-point scale, and guidelines for case studies that can demonstrate the impact (HEFCE, 2011). From the perspective of game theory, there was a similar situation in the Netherlands after 1994 in the distribution of money from the Economic Structure Enhancing Fund (FES) (a fund created from natural gas revenues) which was destined for the knowledge infrastructure. The ‘Committee of Sages’ which advised how the money should be spent, assessed the proposals for research programmes not only according to the quality of the research involved but also according to such things as whether the programmes dis- played cohesion, whether the intellectual property, demand-driven nature, and anchoring of the results were properly arranged, whether management was effective, and whether there was international entrenchment. The com- mittee continued to keep track of the programmes while they were running, and did not hesitate to issue recommendations for improvement on the basis of interim reports (Commissie van Wijzen Kennis en Innovatie, 2011). Past experience shows that it is diff icult to ensure that such a configura- tion remains stable. In the UK, every new round of evaluation leads to heated discussion and changes in policy. In the Netherlands, researchers complained that distribution of the FES funds was politically determined. When a new cabinet was formed in 2010, the government terminated the FES programmes so quickly and in such an ill-considered manner that the realisation is only now beginning to dawn that it was thus surrendering one of its last methods for managing research. Agendas as an instrument for control A third way to arrive at a workable relationship between government and researchers is to reach consensus on the priorities for research. If govern- ment and researchers agree on the goals, government can minimize the cost MANAGiNG WHAT cANNoT Be MANAGeD 95 of monitoring whether the researcher is doing the right research, while the researcher can still investigate what he or she is curious about. This way of organising the relationship between government and researchers has a long tradition in the Netherlands. Because the Dutch National Research Agenda is in line with that tradition, it is a good thing to once more reconsider this historical line in science policy. Agenda setting in Dutch science policy began in agriculture. The National Council for Agricultural Research (NRLO) was established in 1957 as part of the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientif ic Research (TNO) in order to coordinate agricultural research. A compromise organisation, the TNO legislation did provide for a TNO agriculture organisation but the Ministry of Agriculture did not want its institutes to be made part of TNO. The NRLO therefore became a council within TNO that had to coordinate research outside TNO, a seemingly impossible construction. Nevertheless, the NRLO continued to exist for a remarkably long time and was only abolished in 2000. By then it had ceased to be a council within TNO and had evolved into a combination of a sector council and an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (Dijksterhuis and Van der Meulen, 2007). The history of the NRLO also shows how difficult it is to manage research. Initially, the Council tried to do so with typical planning instruments. It categorized the research, mapped out who did what, set up a project administration, and developed criteria for the economic evaluation of the research. This did not lead to the expected rationalisation which would allow priorities to be set on the basis of clear cost-benef it analyses. The development of ‘social frames of reference’, also taking account of ‘psycho- logical’ and ‘legal aspects’, did not help either. In the course of the 1970s, the rationalistic approach slowly disappeared into the background. That approach led to a great deal of paperwork regarding tasks which – as the staff noted – could also be performed in a qualitative manner by experts and other persons involved. That this shift could happen was also because the NRLO had gradually evolved into a participation organisation. Its f ield of activity had been ex- tended to the whole of agricultural research, including research taking place within, for example, Wageningen Agricultural University and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Utrecht. ‘The sector’ also became increasingly involved in the consultations through the then Chamber of Agriculture and the Product Boards. In the 1970s, environmental organisations and other ministries were also given seats on the Council. The NRLO evolved into an organisation made up of larger and smaller consultative bodies within 96 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN which different interests and perspectives regarding agricultural research and innovation were brought together, weighed up, and translated into recommendations for priorities and research programmes. The 1974 Science Budget presented this approach as exemplary for all sectors of Dutch society. Such a comprehensive system has never been implemented. Development of the system of sector councils was fraught with diff iculty and it was only in 1986 that the government submitted the Sector Councils for Research and Development Act [Wet Sectorraden Onderzoek en Ontwikkeling] to Parliament. Besides the NRLO, only three sector councils gained a f irm foothold: the RAWOO (research in the context of development cooperation), the RMNO (environment and nature), and the RGO (health research). Other sector councils were fairly quickly disbanded, for example the Council for Energy Research and the VRA-OGO (research on the built environment), or got stuck at the concept stage (Council for Technological Industrial Research, Sector Council for Chemical Research). By 2000, the sector councils were among the f irst to perish in the drive to reduce the number of bodies advising government. That they had been extremely valuable in managing research played no role in the decision- making on this matter. The unique thing about the sector councils was that, very early on in the history of science policy, they institutionalised the idea that consultation would enable government, research organisations, and civil-society organi- sations to develop research objectives and thus agree on the management of research. This approach produced a range of instruments that deployed long-range strategies providing a political explanation of how the research f itted in with government policy objectives and the needs of society, and vice versa how government and the sector concerned could respond to developments in research. This in turn led to a series of national research programmes in the areas of agriculture, the environment and nature, and healthcare. The same approach was also adopted in the 1990s by the Consultative Committee on Foresight Studies [Overleg Commissie Verkenningen], which was instructed by the then Minister, Jo Ritzen, to organise foresight studies and identify priorities for scientif ic research (OCV, 1997). The activities and reports of the committee covered a wide range of disciplines and research areas, including chemistry, art history, economy, and nanotechnology. After four years, following its f inal report, the committee was disbanded. One of the experiences of the consultative committee was that the bless- ings of science policy were not confined to the sciences and engineering f ields. Among its more successful initiatives was the panel on the future MANAGiNG WHAT cANNoT Be MANAGeD 97 of research in law. The panel observed that current research in law did not match with the needs of stakeholders and major societal developments such as globalisation, high tech innovations and deregulation. As a result, the government put law research high on the agenda in its Science Budget 1997; the research council was asked to set up research programmes to support new research programmes on law and funding became available for a research institute on the internationalization of law. More recently, a number of the FES programmes, such as the Climate Change Spatial Planning Programme [Klimaat voor Ruimte] and Knowledge for Climate [Kennis voor Klimaat] generated methods for programming and also implementing research together with civil-society stakeholders. This institutional entrenchment of the approach disappeared, however, along with the FES programmes. In the context of innovation policy, ‘tripartite consultation’ has been modernised as the ‘Golden Triangle’, and within the key economic sectors long-range strategies and research agendas are referred to as ‘roadmaps’. The idea of joint consultation remains, although the government seems to have hardly any innovation objectives of its own, and has placed implementation and the steering wheel in the hands of industry. In conclusion What does this analytical and historical consideration of the management of science tell us about current science policy? Firstly, that government does wish to pursue science policy. However, the legitimacy of the idea of science policy is based on the importance of science itself rather than on a clear perception of what government can do to manage the system. Researchers too want government to pursue a science policy. One of their main reasons is that science always seems to grow faster than the government’s budget. That applied to the ‘big science’ of large-scale facilities (De Solla Price, 1963), but nowadays it also applies to the ‘little science’ of individual applications for VENI scholarships (Van Arensbergen et al., 2013) and art history (KNAW Verkenningscommissie Kunstgeschiedenis, 2013). If researchers experience bottlenecks in their discipline, career possibilities or research infrastructure, advisory reports quickly call upon government to help. In such cases even scientists apparently have greater trust in govern- ment than in their own organisations and colleagues. For many years, two tracks were visible in science policy. One is today referred to as ‘excellent science’, but it began, once upon a time, with the 98 BAReND vAN DeR MeuleN despairing conclusion by the Minister of Education, Culture and Science that it was unclear just what the quality of scientif ic research in the Nether- lands actually was. Measures aimed at improving quality can almost always count on support from the scientif ic community and – almost as a matter of course – from the scientif ic elite. Thanks to the NWO’s Open Competition, Innovational Research Incentive, Spinoza Prizes, review committees, and ‘Gravitation’ schemes, government’s trust in the quality of research has been f irmly institutionalised. This part of science policy provides a simple answer to the initial question whether government can manage science. Yes it can, by institutionalising proper evaluation and funding processes run by scientists and their organisations. Scientists are said to be curiosity-driven. One of the lessons of science policy is that monitoring performance and quality assessments are helpful as well to drive researchers. The second track is a winding and bumpy one, and one that seems to constantly f ind itself at a dead end: the targeted encouragement of research areas. This track shows how unstable the relationship is between govern- ment and science. Theoretically, institutions can be designed, such as competition and consultation, to make such a policy possible. Looking back, we see that these have in fact been used, in the form of advisory committees, committees of sages, sector councils, and foresight studies, but none of these instruments has become permanently institutionalised. In the Dutch system, it is currently the European Commission that is perhaps the only authority which manages research towards specif ied aims. A signif icant amount of the money in the Horizon 2020 research programme is divided on the basis of Grand Challenges, but it is questionable whether that will remain so. European research policy too has from the outset sought an effective way of managing research. This may sound somewhat defeatist, but it may in fact be the most im- portant lesson for the Dutch Research Agenda. History shows us that the emergence of new f ields of research, the urge to push back the boundaries with larger facilities, and society’s need for relevant knowledge have always been a reason to develop ad hoc solutions to what is a persistent problem. For a long time, the Netherlands had various consultation structures – between government departments, between government and researchers, between researchers, government, and civil-society parties – from which solutions were slowly but surely developed in the form of research agendas, long-range strategies, and research programmes. There is a ‘Vision for Science’ docu- ment [Wetenschapsvisie]. There is a research agenda. Let us hope that from these, research programmes will evolve in which government, civil-society organisations, and researchers will be able to unite their various interests.

       " \"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) was first recognized as a devastating enteric disease in feeder and fattening pig, resembling transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs in the United Kingdom, in 1971. It is a member of Coronavirinae, which are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with the largest genome that are known to infect humans, other mammals, and birds, usually causing subclinical or respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) subgenomic mRNAs, which are transcribed from the genome, produce viral proteins, such as the spike (S, 180-220 kDa), envelope (E, ~8.8 kDa), membrane (M, 27-32 kDa), nucleoprotein (N, [55] [56] [57] [58] , and several other proteins of unknown function [1] [2] [3] . Among the proteins, N, as the RNA-binding protein, play an important role in both virus RNA synthesis and modulating host cell processes, and phosphorylation may regulate these processes by exposing various functional motifs [4, 5] . Several other functions have been postulated for the coronavirus N protein throughout the virus life cycle, including encapsidation, packaging, correct folding of the RNA molecule, the deregulation of the host cell cycle [6] [7] [8] , inhibition of interferon production [9, 10] , up-regulation of COX2 production [11, 12] , up-regulation of AP1 activity [13] , induction of apoptosis [14] [15] [16] , association with host cell proteins [17] , and RNA chaperone activity [18] . Therefore, it is clear that N is a multifunctional protein involved in biological processes related to the survival of PEDV. The nucleolus was one of the first subcellular structures to be identified by early users of the light microscope, appearing as a highly refractive black dot(s) in the nucleus of the cell [19] . The nucleolus is a highly specialized structure that participates in regulation of several host cell processes, including ribosome subunit biogenesis, RNA processing, control of cell growth and response [20] . Interestingly, a cytoplasmic-nucleolar distribution pattern has been reported for the N proteins of several coronaviruses, including representative members of Alphacoronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV), Betacoronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV), and Gammacoronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) [2, 21, 22] . Further study indicated that N protein co-localize with major nucleolar proteins, including nucleolin, fibrillarin, and nucleophosmin [23] [24] [25] . How viral and cellular proteins traffic to the nucleolus and what determines their sub-nucleolar localization is not clearly understood, but proteins that localize to the cytoplasm and nucleus or nucleolus contain multiple signals that determine their subcellular localization [26] , such as nucleolar localization signal (NoLS). Active nuclear import of proteins is mediated by nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are then recognized by proteins of the importin super-family (importin α and β) that mediate the transport across the nuclear envelope using Ran-GTP [27] . Similar to nuclear import, export of a protein from nucleus depends on the presence of a specific nuclear export signal (NES) [28] . The chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1; also known as exportin 1 or Xpo1) has been identified as an export receptor that interacts with the predominant NES, the so-called leucine-rich NES, which is found in a large variety of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins [29, 30] . In fact, some of these NESs are not necessarily leucine rich but rather characterized by several hydrophobic residues. The pharmacological compound leptomycin B (LMB) directly interacts with CRM1 and blocks NES-mediated protein export [31] . Therefore, the proteins can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm with their subcellular localization signals. It was reported previously that N protein nucleolar localization is a common feature in coronaviruses, however, there are different results regarding N subcellular localization in a strain of SARS-CoV [4] . Within the Alphacoronavirus coronaviruses, the precise NoLS and NES of PEDV N and its traffic mechanism are still elusive. Therefore, we have attempted to characterize these signals, and the molecular mechanism responsible for its subcellular localization. In this study, we examined the intracellular localization of the PEDV N protein in PEDV-infected and transfected cell lines using mouse polyclonal antisera and confocal microscopy. By generating a series of deletion and mutagenesis constructions, we found that amino acids 71-90 in region 1 were sufficient for nucleolar retention and we also identified two NESs (aa221-236 and 325-364), but only the NES (aa325-364) was found to be functional in the context of the full-length N protein. The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N and the nuclear export of GFP-NES could be blocked by LMB, an inhibitor of the CRM1, which is the receptor for exportin-1-dependent nuclear export. A polyclonal antibody specifically against the N protein was produced to determine its intracellular localization. We generated anti-N mouse antisera using an E coli-produced fusion protein as the antigen. The antigenicity of the recombinant N protein was confirmed by immunoreactivity with PEDV pigs sera using ELISA assay, which showed high sensitivity and specificity (data not show). To examine the reactivity and specificity of the mouse antiserum, blot results demonstrated that mouse antisera notably reacted with N protein from CV777 strain PEDV, and the cell lysate from Vero E6 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-N showed a band with the same molecular mass to N protein, whereas no band was detected from samples of cells uninfected PEDV and transfected with an empty vector alone ( Figure 1A ,B).  Our results showed that N protein was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm in PEDV CV777-infected cells, while in a few cells fluorescence was also observed in the nucleus (or nucleolus) ( Figure 2A ). No significant fluorescence was observed in uninfected cells (data not shown). A similar observation was also found in Vero E6 cells transfected with plasmid expressing full length N protein ( Figure 2B ). The N protein was observed to localize mainly in the cytoplasm with some protein in the nucleus (or nucleolus). The results suggested that the N protein localized to a subnuclear structure and may contain functional signals. To identify predicted nuclear (or nucleolar) localization signals, and whether they participate in this process or not, we conducted further experiments. After 24 h, infected or transfected, cells were fixed and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using mouse anti-N polyclonal antibody (Green) and stained with PI (red) to visualize the nuclear DNA. Differentially fluorescing images were gathered separately using confocal microscopy. Images were obtained with a 63× oil objective. To identify whether there were subcellular localization signals in PEDV N protein, we first conducted a bioinformatics analysis on the protein using existing motif prediction algorithms. Predict NLS [32] and PSORT II [33] were used to identify potential NLSs, and the NES predictor (Net NES) [29] was used to identify potential NESs. Predict NLS found no NLSs, whereas PSORT II indicated that PEDV N protein contained a pat7 motif (261PKKNKSR267). Net NES found no NES. In other studies, coronaviruses, such as TGEV, MHV, IBV, and SARS-CoV showed a common characteristic, that of NLS-rich in C-terminal. So through amino acid sequence comparison among groups we also found a basic amino acid-rich short peptide (383RKKEKKNKRE393) in C-terminal. We presumed it might play a role in N protein localization as a new localization signal, and named it patx. Although N protein contains putative nuclear (or nucleolar) localization signals (N (or No) LS), it is not known whether they are functional or not. To investigate whether these and other unknown signals operated to determine the subcellular trafficking of N protein, we utilized AcGFP as a fusion marker to observe the localization characteristics of N and truncated N protein in live cells. The B23.1-DsRed fusion protein was used to tag the nucleolus, so we could analyze nucleolar localization properties and colocalization in cotransfected cells by live cell imaging (direct fluorescence) or confocal microscopy. At 24 h post-cotransfection, live cell imaging indicated that as previously shown, AcGFP evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm but not the nucleolar, on the contrary AcGFP-N protein localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleolus but not the nucleus in Vero E6 cells ( Figure 3 ). From the above results we hypothesize that there is a NoLS in N, which can guide exogenous protein to the nucleolus. To determine the exact NoLS, the AcGFP-tagged truncated different regions of the N protein were transfected into Vero E6 cells, which did not destroy the integrity of the signals. In our observation, AcGFP-NR1 mainly localized to nucleolar structures, AcGFP-NR2 localized predominantly to the cytoplasm and appeared also to accumulate in the nucleolus to the low level as the cytoplasm, whereas AcGFP-NR3 predominantly localized to the cytoplasm; AcGFP-NR1+2 protein same to AcGFP-N and localized to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, AcGFP-NR2+3 protein localized predominantly in cytoplasmic ( Figure 3 ). This evidence demonstrated that region 2 targeted to the nucleolus with weaker enrichment, while region 1 localized to the nucleolus with stronger enrichment. Thus, we speculated that region 1 have an effect on the nucleolar localization of N. This data also suggested that region 2 and 3 may contain NESs because region 2 and 3 was mainly directed to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, although region 2 and 3 contained predicted pat7 and patx motifs, respectively, they could either have been submissive to the NES or not functional. None of these fusion proteins had a distribution similar to AcGFP only. To further identify the sequence for nucleolar localization in detail, a series of expression constructs containing fragments of region 1 were constructed. Vero E6 cells were cotransfected with, either pAcGFP-NR1 1-50 , pAcGFP-NR1 51-100 , or pAcGFP-NR1 101-147 , and pDsRed-B23.1, analyzed using live cell imaging and confocal microscopy at 24 h post-transfection. The data indicated that AcGFP-NR1 51-100 colocalized with B23.1, whereas the other two fusion proteins did not ( Figure 4 ). To further refine the amino acids involved in nucleolar localization, 20 amino acid overlapping motifs encompassing amino acids 51-100 were cloned into downstream of AcGFP, creating plasmids pAcGFP-NR1 51-70 , pAcGFP-NR1 61-80 , pAcGFP-NR1 71-90 , and pAcGFP-NR1 81-100 for the expression of recombinant fusion proteins. Vero E6 cells were cotransfected with these constructs and pDsRed-B23.1, at 24 h post-cotransfection analyzed using live cell imaging and confocal microscopy ( Figure 5 ). The data indicated that AcGFP-NR1 71-90 localized to the nucleolus and colocalized with B23.1. Therefore, the amino acids at positions 71-90 in PEDV N protein were capable to localize in the nucleolus. Comparison of the PEDV N protein NoLS with known cellular and viral NoLSs showed that the R87 and R89 of the PEDV N protein NoLS might be conserved, although some cellular and viral NoLSs in this site did not contain basic amino acids ( Figure 6 ). Current work is directed at further resolving PEDV NoLS sequence, including the contribution of individual amino acid residues. Red squares indicate the amino acids of conservation. The cellular and viral NoLSs are described in NoLS IBV N protein [34] , NoLS PRRSV N [20] , NoLS HTLV-1 Rex [35] , NoLS HSV gamma1 34.5 [36] , NoLS MDM2 [37] , NoLS MDV MEQ [38] , NoLS NF-kappa [39] , NoLS Nuclear VCP-like protein (NVL2) [40] , NoLS p 120 [41] , NoLS surviving-deltaEx3 [42] , NoLS (GGNNV) protein alpha [43] , BHV-1 BICP27 [44] , Earning-associated protein 1-19 [45] , HSV-1 ICP27 [46] , NoLS angiogen [47] , NoLS Fibroblast growth factor-2 [48] , NoLS herpes-mareks MEQ [38] , NoLS HIC p40 [49] , NoLS HIV-1 rev [50] , NoLS HIV-1 Tat [51] . To map the amino acid sequence of region 2 responsible for its nuclear export, similar to the approach used to identify the NoLS in region 1, region 2 was subdivided into two distinct components. Amino acids 148-220 and 221-294 were placed downstream of AcGFP, creating expression vectors pAcGFP-NR2 148-220 and pAcGFP-NR2 221-294 . These expression plasmids were transfected into Vero E6 cells, the nuclear was stained with DAPI at 24 h post-transfection indicated that amino acids 148-220 directed AcGFP to the cytoplasm and nucleus and had a subcellular localization similar to AcGFP. In contrast, amino acids 221-294 directed AcGFP to the cytoplasm; further investigation revealed that amino acids 241-260 and 261-294, when fused to AcGFP, directed this protein to the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas amino acids 221-240 directed AcGFP to the cytoplasm (Figure 7) . To further define the amino acids involved in cytoplasm trafficking, we conducted a tetra-alanine substitution mutagenesis of amino acids 221-240. These were placed down stream of AcGFP, creating expression plasmids, pAcGFP-NR2 221-224DLVA-AAAA , pAcGFP-NR2 225-228AVKD-AAAA , pAcGFP-NR2 229-232ALKS-AAAA , pAcGFP-NR2 233-236LGIG-AAAA and pAcGFP-NR2 237-240ENPD-AAAA . Therefore, in some cases, the wild-type alanine was not substituted. The data indicated that substituting 221-224DLVA-AAAA, 229-232ALKS-AAAA, and 233-236LGIG-AAAA abolished cytoplasm trafficking. The remaining tetra-alanine substitutions had no effect on cytoplasm trafficking (Figure 8 ), indicating that amino acids 221 DLVAAVKDALKSLGIG 236 were involved in cytoplasm trafficking. To test whether this amino acid sequence was involved in directing the cytoplasm trafficking of N protein, this motif was deleted in the context of full-length N protein tagged to AcGFP (plasmid pAcGFP-N ∆221-236 ). This plasmid was transfected into Vero E6 cells and the subcellular localization of the resulting fusion protein AcGFP-N ∆221-236 investigated using confocal microscopy. There was no difference at 24 h post-transfection ( Figure 9 ) compared with cells expressing AcGFP-N protein. This data also indicated that the NES identified in region 2 was not necessary for cytoplasm trafficking in PEDV N protein. As region 3 of PEDV N protein localized to the cytoplasm, thus, the similar approach was used to identify the NES in region 3. The data indicated that amino acids 295-394 directed AcGFP to the cytoplasm; further investigation revealed that amino acids 325-364 directed AcGFP to the cytoplasm ( Figure 10 ). Taken together, we proposed that amino acids 325-364 are necessary and sufficient to direct N protein to the cytoplasm, and no other signals are involved.  To determine if the PEDV N protein was exported via the CRM1-mediated pathway, the subcellular localization of the pAcGFP-N, pAcGFP-NR3 or pAcGFP-NR3 325-364 , was compared between Vero E6 cells left untreated or treated with 2.5 ng/mL LMB. As shown in Figure 11 , the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of PEDV N, NR3 and NR3 325-364 was completely inhibited by LMB. The finding indicates that PEDV N shuttling activity was affected by LMB and, thus, suggests that PEDV N protein was transported via the classical CRM1-dependent pathway. PEDV is an important pathogen causing viral diarrhea in the swine industry. Although much research has been carried out on the general characteristics of PEDV, few reports have been reported on the functions of the PEDV structural proteins, especially N protein. N protein plays an important role in virus replication and modulation of host cellular machinery, which should be a result of its self-interaction and interaction with other viral and cellular proteins and with virus and host cell nucleic acids. Therefore, it is important to understand the subcellular localization properties of the PEDV N protein. Figure 11 . The nuclear export mechanism of PEDV N. Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding pAcGFP-N, pAcGFP-NR3, pAcGFPNR3 365-394 , with or without treatment with LMB, and examined live 24 h after transfection by confocal microscopy. Each image is representative of the majority of the cells observed in the same cells. The nucleolus (No) is arrowed where appropriate. To enter and export from the nucleus, all molecules or cargoes must traverse a large macromolecular structure called the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is located in the nuclear envelope. Small molecules up to 40-60 kDa or less than 10 nm in diameter can passively diffuse through the NPC, but if proteins are larger than this size-exclusion limit and/or are required to move against a concentration gradient, then transport requires energy-driven mechanisms [52] . In this case, most proteins should contain the appropriate trafficking motifs, such as NLS. The rules and signals that govern the nuclear localization of proteins are well defined. NLSs can be classified into several categories, including the pat4 and pat7 motifs and bipartite NLSs, are composed of basic amino acids of a given sequence length. The pat4 motif consists of a continuous stretch of (usually) four basic amino acids, and the pat7 motif starts with a proline residue and is followed by six amino acids [32, 53] . By contrast, the signals that govern nucleolar localization and retention are not well defined [26] . The motifs involved are usually rich in arginine and lysine residues; however there is no immediately obvious consensus sequence or structure. Proteins that localize to the nucleolus can also have nuclear-import motifs. The NoLSs that have been identified so far can be grouped into those that contain single motif and those that contain multiple motifs [54] . In this study, the living cells fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy were employed for investigating the subcellular localization and nuclear import and export mechanisms of PEDV N protein. It is well known that living cells fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy has an advantage over conventional in vitro nuclear transport assays in that cells are not physically damaged by microinjection, detergent, or mechanical perforation, this means that cellular components important for trafficking, such as nuclear import and export receptors, the MT network, intact [55, 56] . Our results indicated that PEDV N protein mainly distributes throughout the cytoplasm with localization to a substructure within the nucleolus in infected cells. Similar results were also obtained in transfected cells. To eliminate the influence of charged protein migration to the nucleolus post-fixation, and to investigate the nuclear (or nucleolar) localization of PEDV N protein and the functions of these motifs in more detail, we generated constructs that express the protein (or parts of the protein) as a fusion with enhanced green fluorescent protein. The protein could then be detected by direct fluorescence using both live-cell and confocal microscopy. No difference in the localization of either protein was observed between different cell lines, and the presence of a fluorescent tag at either the N terminus or C terminus of N protein did not affect the localization of the fusion protein compared with native protein [2, 4] . Furthermore, the B23.1 gene was amplified from the Vero E6 cells and then fused with DsRed in order to visualize the nucleolus. Transfection assay results indicated that AcGFP localized predominately to the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but not the nucleolus. The characteristics of AcGFP-N protein localized to either the cytoplasm alone or the cytoplasm and nucleolus, with a maximum of 60% of transfected cells exhibiting this phenotype at 24 h. Our studies indicated that fusing AcGFP with PEDV N protein increased the molecular weight of this protein (82 kDa) above the size exclusion limit of the nuclear pore complex, and it could not diffuse passively through the NPC. This result suggested that there must be some signals in N protein that determined the nucleolar localization. A number of viruses and viral proteins can disrupt nucleolar architecture [57] , and the N protein of coronavirus can also localize to the nucleolus in a cell cycle dependent manner and this may be related to dynamic trafficking [58] . A previous study of SARS-CoV indicated the N protein inhibited B23 phosphorylation and might influence ribosome biogenesis to suppress host gene expression and create a more favorable milieu for virus survival [25] , so the N protein of PEDV might take part in some cellular process. To investigate whether PEDV N protein contained a NoLS, the protein was expressed as a series of single and overlapping regions. This preliminary analysis indicated that PEDV N protein contained a NoLS in region 1. Deletion mutagenesis delineated amino acid PEDV N 71-90, a 20 aa motif that modulated nucleolar localization. Furthermore, comparison with cellular and viral NoLSs, the data indicated that R87 and R89 may be critical for the nucleolar localization. For the site of replication and virus assembly is the cytoplasm, if the subcellular localization of the nucleocapsid protein is in the nucleolar, then the protein is not available for RNA synthesis, encapsidation and assembly, and therefore progeny virus production might be less efficient. However, if such proteins do target the nucleolar as part of a virus replication strategy then they will contain appropriate targeting signals. Thus, these will include not only NLSs and NoLSs, but perhaps more importantly NES. By using a series of N deletion mutants fused to the AcGFP and tetra-alanine substitution mutagenesis, we identified two NES site in region 2 (aa221-236) and region 3 (aa325-364), but NES in region 2 was deleted in the context of full length N protein did not affect cytoplasm trafficking, suggesting that the NES presented in region 2 submissive to the NES in region 3 or not function. Furthermore, PEDV N protein nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was specifically blocked by LMB treatment suggested that PEDV N protein is transported via the classical CRM1-dependent pathway. Vero E6 was grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . Vero E6 cells were infected with PEDV strain CV777 kindly provided by Pensaert M B at MOI = 1, and were seeded and after 24 h for both indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. All enzymes used for cloning procedures were purchased from Takara (Dalian, China) except T4 DNA ligase from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, USA). pDsRed-B23.1 encodes a fusion of DsRed protein to the amino terminus of B23.1 and pAcGFP-N encodes a C-terminally GFP-epitope-tagged version of PEDV N and has been previously described [59] . The regions and subregions were amplified by PCR using pAcGFP-N as a template. Primers incorporated 5' BamH I site and 3' Xho1 used for cloning into pET30a; Primers incorporated 5' Kpn I site and 3' Xho I site used for cloning into pcDNA3.1 and the other primers incorporated 5' Xhol I site and 3' Kpn I site used for cloning into pAcGFP-C1. The cloning procedures for constructing most of recombinant plasmids were similar and all primers are listed in Table 1 . At all times, numbers used in primer or construct names denoting amino acid numbers refer to their position on the full length N protein. For the Tetra-alanine substitution, each pair of oligonucleotide strands was annealed, and the resultant double-stranded DNA fragments were cloned into the vector pAcGFP-C1. Additionally, the NES of NR2 was deleted in the context of full-length N protein by overlapping PCR using forward primer 1-U and reverse primer 1-L (Table 1) to generate one PCR product and forward primer 2-U and reverse primer 2-L (Table 1) to generate the second PCR product. A second round of PCR was performed using both PCR products as templates and 1-U and 2-L as the forward and reverse primer, respectively. The resulting product was subcloned into pAcGFP-C1. All plasmid were confirmed by sequencing analysis.  The recombinant 6× His-tagged N protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells after induction with 1 mM IPTG for 5 h in LB-medium at 37 °C . The recombinant protein was purified by a GravitrapTM affinity column (GE Healthcare, Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BALB/c mice were immunized with 0.1~0.2 mg of purified recombinant N protein injected subcutaneously at multiple sites on the back. Booster injections were given two and four weeks later. Blood was drown from the mouse at the fifth week following the immunization, and the blood was allowed to clot at 4 °C and the antiserum was recovered by centrifugation at 5,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C . A control serum was made by injecting normal saline under the same conditions. The animal experiment was approved by Harbin Veterinary Research Institute and performed in accordance with animal ethics guidelines and approved protocols. The animal Ethics Committee approval number is Heilongjiang-SYXK-2006-032. On the day before transfection, 0.5~2 × 10 5 cells grown on 35 mm culture dishes so that 60%-80% confluent cell monolayers were transfected with plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Protein samples were collected 48 h after transfection by direct lysis of the cells in 5× SDS protein sample buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were boiled for 5 min, resolved with 12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted with the following antibodies. For the infection and transfection protein samples: the N protein polyclonal antiserum was the first antibody and IRDyeTM700DX Conjugated Affinity Purified anti-Mouse IgG (H&L)(Mouse) (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) was the second antibody; The images were acquired by The ODYSSEYTM Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Vero E6 Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed 24 h post-infection (or post-transfection) with 50% methanol-50% acetone for analysis by indirect immunofluorescence using mouse anti-PEDV N polyclonal sera (1:50 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to perforation using 0.2% Triton X-100. Then the cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) (50 μg/mL) (Sigma) to visualize nuclear DNA. Samples were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. For AcGFP and DsRed fusion expression constructs, co-transfection analyses were carried out. At 24 h post-transfection, subcellular localization properties in living cells were analyzed by laser confocal scanning microscope (Leica Laser Technik, Heidelberg, Germany) with appropriate filters. In order to better display the results at the time of identify the NES in the regions of NR2 and NR3, at 24 h after transfection, cells on glass cover slips were rinsed with PBS and subjected to fixation using 50% methanol-50% acetone for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Then the nuclear was stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (0.05μg /mL) (Sigma) and analyzed by confocal microscope. Cells were transfected with pAcGFP-N, pAcGFP-NR3, or pAcGFP-NR3 325-364 . At 18 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS followed by either treated with 2.5 ng/mL LMB diluted with medium or left in unsupplemented cell culture medium for a further 6 h, then analyzed by used confocal microscope. A NoLS (aa71-90) and a functional NES (aa325-364) of PEDV N protein were identified for the first time. Additionally, the N protein was demonstrated to transport between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm through the NES by CRM1-dependent pathway.\",\n",
       " 'APPENDIX B Federal Geospatial Data Sources Identified This appendix contains the 465 programs, offices, or major initiatives identified at 30 different federal agencies—namely the federal publicly accessible geospatial sources that we identified. These sources, and their corresponding Web sites, were found during the data collection phase of our research from spring 2002 through summer 2002. These Web sites were revisited during our analysis process that continued through spring 2003. However, since that time, some of these agency programs, offices, and initiatives and their corresponding Web sites may have changed or gone away. In addi- tion, there may be new programs, offices, or initiatives, or ones not identified in our extensive survey, that also make geospatial informa- tion publicly available. In most cases, this table lists agencies and major suborganiza- tions (such as subagencies) along with the Web site of interest for the major program, office, or initiative. However, in some cases, we go below the major program, office, or initiative level because of the diversity in federal agencies, their activities and data, and its relevance to critical sites. For example, EPA’s Envirofacts Data Warehouse con- tains data from different major regulatory programs, such as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and water discharge permit information. 135 136 Mapping the Risks Table B.1 Federal Geospatial Data Sources Agency/ Title of Web Site for Program, Suborganization Office, or Initiative Location Architect of the Capitol Architect of the Capitol Web www.aoc.gov Site Capitol Visitor Center Capitol Visitor www.aoc.gov/cvc/cvc_ Project Office Center—Overview overview.htm Central Intelligence Central Intelligence Agency & www.cia.gov Agency Director of Central Intelligence Defense Nuclear Defense Nuclear Facilities www.dnfsb.gov Facilities Safety Board Safety Board Department of United States Department of www.usda.gov Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture’s Home Page Agricultural Market- AMS at USDA—AMS Food www.ams.usda.gov/cp/ ing Service Purchase Resources—Main Menu AMS at USDA, Fruit and www.ams.usda.gov/fv/ Vegetable Programs, Fresh fpbdigimage.html Product Standards and Quality Certification Auditing Services www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/ arc/audit.htm Livestock and Grain Reports www.ams.usda.gov/lsg/ mncs/index.htm AMS at USDA—Science and www.ams.usda.gov/ Technology—Pesticide Data science/pdp/index.htm Program Grain Transportation Report www.ams.usda.gov/ Homepage tmd/grain.htm Agricultural Research USDA-ARS Hydrology and http://hydrolab.ars Service Remote Sensing Laboratory usda.gov Animal and Plant Animal and Plant Health www.aphis.usda.gov Health Inspection Inspection Service (APHIS) Service CAHM [Center for Animal www.aphis.usda.gov/ Health Monitoring] Home Page vs/ceah/cahm/index. htm Federal Geospatial Data Sources Identified 137 Table B.1—Continued Agency/ Title of Web Site for Program, Suborganization Office, or Initiative Location USDA (cont.)

    "#new_docs = 'Cerebrovascular disease, or vascular brain disease, refers to multiple conditions that affect the blood vessels and blood circulation in the brain, such as stroke and vascular malformation. Cerebrovascular disease is the secondTrusted Source leading cause of death in the world. It is also the fifthTrusted Source leading cause of death in the U.S. and was responsible for 37.6Trusted Source deaths per 100,000 individuals in the U.S. in 2017.In addition to causing physical disability, cerebrovascular diseases can result in the development and progression of cognitive impairment and dementia.Moreover, health experts also associate subclinical cerebrovascular damage — that is, brain abnormalities observed in the early stages of the cerebrovascular disease before its symptoms become evident — with an increased risk of dementia. Healthy lifestyle modifications, including making dietary changes, increasing physical activity levels, and quitting smoking, can reduce the risk of cerebrovascular disease.For instance, there is a relation between higher intake of fish and a lower risk of stroke. Fish are an excellent source of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which may mediate these benefits on cerebrovascular health. However, the evidence that fish consumption reduces vascular brain damage before the onset of the cerebrovascular disease is mixed. A recent cross-sectional study investigated the link between fish consumption and vascular brain damage in healthy older adults before cerebrovascular disease onset. The study reports an association between eating fish two or more times per week and lower levels of brain abnormalities related to vascular brain damage, especially in individuals under the age of 75 years. The study senior author, Dr. Cecilia Samieri, a senior researcher at the University of Bordeaux in France, explains: “Our results are exciting because they show something as simple as eating two or more servings of fish each week is associated with fewer brain lesions and other markers of vascular brain damage, long before obvious signs of dementia appear. However, eating that much fish did not have a protective effect in people 75 years of age and older. The study appears in the journal Neurology. Evaluating cerebrovascular health The present study analyzed data collected between March 1999 and March 2001 as part of the Three-City Study, which aims to understand the relationship between vascular diseases and dementia in people aged 65 years and older. The analysis involved 1,623 people with an average age of 72.3 years and residing in Dijon, France. Individuals were excluded from the study if they had a dementia diagnosis, a history of stroke, or hospitalization for cardiovascular diseases. The researchers evaluated the extent of subclinical cerebrovascular damage using brain MRI scans. They analyzed the MRI scans for the presence of three markers associated with subclinical cerebrovascular damage white matter abnormalities infarcts enlargement of perivascular spaces White matter consists of nerve fibers, or axons, that relay messages between brain regions. Cerebrovascular disease can result in nerve fiber degeneration and cause damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerve fibers. This leads to white matter abnormalities. Infarcts are regions of dead tissue resulting from inadequate blood supply. This is often due to a blood clot in a blood vessel. Perivascular spaces are fluid-filled spaces surrounding blood vessels. When enlarged, they are associated with cerebral small vessel disease. Each of these markers predicts the extent of cognitive decline related to cerebrovascular disease. However, previous studies have shown that a single measure obtained by combining multiple cerebrovascular disease markers can be a better predictor of cognitive decline than any single marker.'\n",
